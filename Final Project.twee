:: Angry Forest [angryForest] {"position":"4300,2100","size":"100,100"}
The whispers turn into guttural growls. The forest is angry, its shadows seem to twist and close in around you. You feel the ground beneath you trembling as if the forest itself is alive and enraged. The newly visible path leads to an old shrine hidden in the trees.The whispers grow louder, almost like they're telling you a story. You start to feel drowsy as vines slowly creep closer to where you're sitting.

:: Approach [forked] {"position":"4700,900","size":"100,100"}
As you step closer, the figure leans toward you, its voice a soft whisper carried on the breeze. ‚ÄúFollow your heart to find the heart,‚Äù it murmurs, gesturing toward a fork in the path ahead. Two trails stretch into the shadows, each bathed in an otherworldly glow‚Äîone lined with blossoming flowers, the other alive with the flicker of countless fireflies.

:: Approach the Deer [unlightedPath] {"position":"3000,1500","size":"100,100"}
You step toward the deer, and its eyes meet yours. Its voice is calm yet filled with sorrow as it says, "This is what our forest used to be." Suddenly, the light dims, and everything around you fades. The blooming trees, the magical creatures, the beauty of the forest‚Äîit all vanishes as if it had never existed.

The deer stands alone before you, its presence still radiant despite the emptiness now surrounding it. "I am Eryndor, the Keeper of Life in this forest," it says. "Your journey has brought you here, but the path ahead will define your fate. Choose wisely."

Eryndor presents three paths for you to decide:

[[Restore the Balance|Restore the balance]]

:: Blue Sapphire [stoneHold] {"position":"3800,900","size":"100,100"}

:: Catch a Firefly [fireflies] {"position":"4800,1300","size":"100,100"}
As you extend your hand, a single firefly drifts closer, its gentle glow illuminating your fingers. It settles softly in your palm, its light pulsing like a tiny heartbeat, as if waiting for your next move.

With all three keys in hand, the deer steps forward, its form shimmering like sunlight through the trees. "You have restored the balance," it says. "The forest remembers your choices and your sacrifices. But balance is fragile. It must be protected."

The forest hums softly, its paths opening before you. Though your journey is far from over, you feel a peace settle over the echoes around you.

[[Step into the forest path]]


:: Continue up the slope [rockySymbols] {"position":"3800,1500","size":"100,100"}

The ghostly figure introduces itself as the Echo keeper. All paths have led you here‚Äîto the heart of the forest. The Echo Keeper stands before you, holding a seed of life. It speaks in a voice that echoes through the grove: ‚ÄúYour choices have shaped this moment. Take the seed, challenge me, or find your own way.‚Äù

:: Enter the doorway [tree] {"position":"3300,1300","size":"100,100"}
The doorway opens into a serene moonlit grove surrounded by towering trees and glowing moss. In the center stands an ancient tree with faces carved into its bark, their expressions shifting as though alive. An inscription on the tree reads: ‚ÄúAnswers come only to those who ask.‚Äù Will you ask the tree for guidance, or sit quietly and wait to see what happens?

:: Failure {"position":"2800,1700","size":"100,100"}
The air around you grows heavy, and the forest seems to close in. Shadows stretch longer, and the light begins to fade. Whispers rise from all directions, soft at first, then louder, circling you like a chant:

"You have failed the test."

The words echo in your mind, relentless and sharp, as though the forest itself is disappointed in you. The trees creak and groan, their branches shifting as if alive, their judgment weighing heavy on your soul.

You feel the ground beneath you tremble. The path ahead is lost, swallowed by the darkness.

[[Face the Angry Forest|Angry Forest]]



:: Finding your own way [echoes] {"position":"3800,2300","size":"100,100"}
As you push forward, determined to make your own way, the forest seems to grow quieter, like it‚Äôs watching, waiting. Each step feels heavier, and the trees seem taller, their shadows stretching longer. You‚Äôre not sure how long you‚Äôve been walking when you come to a clearing bathed in a strange, silver light. It feels like the forest has brought you here‚Äîlike this is where it all ends.

From the shadows, the Echo Keeper appears, its glowing figure shifting and flickering like it‚Äôs part of the forest itself. It doesn‚Äôt speak right away, but when it does, its voice is calm and steady. "Every choice you made has left an echo," it says. "These echoes hold the story of your journey‚Äîhow you‚Äôve changed, and how you‚Äôve changed the forest."

It stretches out a hand, its gaze fixed on you. "Now, it‚Äôs time to give me the echoes you‚Äôve gathered. They will decide what happens next."

The trail of flowers leads you into a dreamlike clearing, the air heavy with the scent of blossoms. The petals seem to shimmer faintly, as though they hold some kind of energy. A sense of calm washes over you, but the forest‚Äôs intent is still unclear. The flowers seem to call out to you, their glow pulsating in rhythm with your heartbeat.

[[Enter the doorway]]


:: Follow the Lighted Path [lightedPath] {"position":"3000,1300","size":"100,100"}
As you walk along the glowing path, the forest begins to change around you. The once-dark trees now bloom with vibrant flowers, their petals shimmering like tiny lanterns. Streams of light filter through the canopy, making the air itself seem alive. You see creatures you‚Äôve never imagined‚Äîfoxes with glowing tails, birds with iridescent feathers, and rabbits hopping among flowers that sparkle like jewels. Even the trees seem to hum with a quiet, ancient melody.

While you‚Äôre admiring the beauty of the forest, a majestic deer steps into your path. Its antlers glow faintly, entwined with vines and blossoms. Its coat seems to shimmer, changing colors like the forest itself, and its eyes hold a wisdom that feels almost overwhelming. The deer gazes at you for a moment, then gestures with its head as if inviting you closer.

[[Approach the Deer]]

[[Place the gem in the hollow at the cave entrance|Enter the doorway]]


:: Guidance [shrine] {"position":"4400,2500","size":"100,100"}
Your choices have led you here. The shrine, ancient and weathered, stands ominously before you. The ground feels cold beneath your feet, and the air itself seems to pull you downward. A deep voice echoes from the shrine: "Balance requires sacrifice."

:: Root Key [rootRiddle] {"position":"2600,1800","size":"100,100"}
The deer leads you to a towering ancient tree. Its bark is etched with carvings that glow faintly in the dim light. The tree seems alive, humming softly as you approach. The deer gestures to an inscription:

"I grow where I‚Äôm planted but never move. Break me, and I grow louder. What am I?"

The answer feels just out of reach, the carvings almost daring you to guess.

"Every choice you made has left an echo," it says. "These echoes hold the story of your journey‚Äîhow you‚Äôve changed, and how you‚Äôve changed the forest."

It stretches out a hand, its gaze fixed on you. "Now, it‚Äôs time to give me the echoes you‚Äôve gathered. They will decide what happens next."

[[‚¨Ö|Title]]
<div class="story">One day, while you were on your usual hike, something caught your eye‚Äîa spot you‚Äôd never noticed before. It was strange, almost like it was calling to you. Curious, you stepped closer to the edge to get a better look. But just as you thought the ground was solid, it gave way.

You fell.

The drop felt endless. The wind rushed past you, and everything spun out of control. Then, nothing. Just darkness.

When you woke up, you weren‚Äôt on the trail anymore. You were in a forest‚Äîa place that felt alive. It was beautiful but‚Ä¶ strange, almost too perfect, like it wasn‚Äôt real. A part of you wanted to explore, but there was this gnawing feeling, a sense of unease. You‚Äôd heard the stories‚Äîabout a forest where people go and never come back, where every step binds them tighter to its magic.

You looked around for the cliff, for a way out, but it was gone. All that was left was the forest, waiting silently. Watching.

You don‚Äôt know what brought you here or what‚Äôs ahead‚Äîanswers or more questions‚Äîbut standing still isn‚Äôt an option.

The only way is forward. And so, your journey begins.

The trees loom above, their bark splitting into hollow faces, their empty eyes filled with judgment. Shadows twist and close in, and the forest roars with anger.
